# GTFS Route Zonal Calculation
Small app that allows you to upload the files "route.txt", "trips.txt" and "shapes.txt" from the GTFS and get the percentage of miles each route does on a given set of polygons.
It only works in the Sunline Transit Area as of now.

Deployed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Map with [Pydeck](https://pydeck.gl/). 

You can take a look to the app [here.](https://share.streamlit.io/yeying123/gtfs_zonal_calculation/main/GTFS_Zonal_Calculation.py)
