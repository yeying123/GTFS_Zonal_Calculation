# km_per_polygon
Small app that allows you to upload the files "route.txt", "trips.txt" and "shapes.txt" from the GTFS and get the number of kilometers each route does on a given set of polygons.
It only works in the city of Leverkusen, Germany as of now.

Deployed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Map with [Pydeck](https://pydeck.gl/). 

You can take a look to the app [here.](https://share.streamlit.io/bondify/km_per_polygon/main/read_zipfile.py)
